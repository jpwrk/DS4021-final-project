##  Software and platform section
This project was implemented using Python 3.10+ in Jupyter Notebook. The required packages include:

- pandas – for data loading and manipulation

- numpy – for numerical operations

- scikit-learn – for preprocessing, cross-validation, and metrics

- PyTorch – for building and training the neural network

- matplotlib and seaborn – for visualizations, including confusion matrices

The code was developed and tested on Windows 10, but it is compatible with macOS and Linux. Standard CPU hardware was used, and GPU acceleration was not required.
